            "content": "It sounds like you're craving understanding and support, but instead you're met with criticism—and that sparks the anger. Sometimes anger is like a shield protecting deeper feelings, like hurt or frustration. Do you think under that anger there's something softer you wish they'd see?"

Since you can’t control their words, maybe the question is: how can you start giving yourself that recognition first? What’s one thing you’ve done recently that you can honestly be proud of?"

            "role": "user",
            "content": "Yeah, I think I needed to hear that. Also, random detail: my dad keeps saying I should call <PERSON> at <PHONE_NUMBER> to ask for job advice, but I feel awkward."

            "role": "bot",
            "content": "It's okay to feel hesitant. Reaching out can feel vulnerable, but sometimes mentors or relatives can give perspective. Maybe you could draft a simple message first, like an email, before making the call. Would practicing it make it less intimidating?"
