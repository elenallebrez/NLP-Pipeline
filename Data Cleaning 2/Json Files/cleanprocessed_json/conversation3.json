    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "That sounds really lonely, like you’re surrounded by people but still feel unseen. Belonging isn’t just about being with others, it’s about feeling accepted for who you are. Do you feel like you’re holding back parts of yourself around them?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Yeah, I pretend to be more fun than I actually feel, just so they keep me around."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "That must be exhausting wearing a mask to fit in. It shows how much you value connection, but it also means you’re hiding the parts that make you you. What do you think might happen if you let a little more of your true self show with them?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I'm scared they won't like the real me. It happened once in high school, with <PERSON>, and she stopped talking to me."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "That memory with <PERSON> sounds painful—it makes sense you’d carry that fear. But not everyone will react the same way. Who in your life now feels safest to test showing a little more of your true self?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Maybe my cousin <PERSON> but he lives in <LOCATION> so we don’t talk much."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "Even distance doesn't erase connection. You could try sending <PERSON> a message—something small and honest. When was the last time you spoke with him?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Maybe in June, like around <DATE>. He sent me a funny TikTok link (:laughing)."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "So there's still a bridge there. Humor is often a doorway to honesty. What if next time you reply, you share something real about how you're doing instead of just reacting to the meme?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I don't know... feels awkward. Also, my phone is broken. I have to use my mom's old number to get WhatsApp working."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "Technology hiccups aside, you still found a way—that’s resilience. Even if you feel awkward, remember: authenticity often starts messy but gets easier with practice. What would be one simple truth you’d feel okay telling <PERSON>?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Maybe just \"I miss hanging out with you.\" That's safe enough."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "That's beautiful and genuine. Imagine if someone told you that—how would you feel?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I'd feel really good, actually. But sometimes I overthink. Like I even drafted an email to write to <PERSON> but never sent it."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "It sounds like you already take brave steps—you write, you draft, you prepare. Even if you don’t send it, that shows the desire for deeper connection. What stopped you from pressing send?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I thought she'd think I'm weird, like \"why are you emailing instead of texting?\""
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "That’s a fair worry. Social \"rules\" can feel rigid. But sometimes breaking them makes the moment more meaningful. What if instead of worrying about her judgment, you framed it as \"I just wanted to write to you differently this time\"?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Mmm maybe. I'm not so sure. Also, I hate my handwriting, but writing a letter would be nice too (:scroll)."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "That’s such a tender idea. A handwritten letter can carry weight no text can. It doesn’t need to be perfect; it just needs to be yours. Who knows, maybe she’ll keep it forever."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Do you really think so? My friend <PERSON> once kept a silly note I gave him in <DATE>, so maybe you’re right."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "Absolutely. Those small gestures often mean more than we realize. And the fact that <PERSON> valued that note shows you already have proof people treasure your authentic self."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "True, I guess I need to trust more. Also, sorry for spelling mistakes, I type too fast (:embarrassed)."
    },
    {
      "role": "bot",
      "content": "No worries at all. Your words are what matter, not perfect typing. You're showing up honestly right now, and that's the first step toward belonging."
