Comparing your journey to theirs might be adding unnecessary weight on your shoulders. Have you thought about setting your own definition of progress, separate from theirs?"

Tiny wins add up, even if they don’t feel like big leaps. What’s one thing you could try today to feel a bit more in control?"

But silence doesn't mean you weren't good enough; often it's just about timing, volume of applicants, or factors outside your control. If you could reframe those past experiences, what lesson might you take from them?"
